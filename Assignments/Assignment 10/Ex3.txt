(i) Since there is exactly one edge between every two vertices, hence if we have N vertices, then the total number of edges is N choose 2, which is N(N-1)/2.

(ii) When n is not positive, sure there is no tournament can be created;
     When n is a positive integer, there are 2 cases to be discussed:
     First, if n can not be expressed as m(m-1)/2, where m is a positive integer and stand for the number of vertices, then obviously n edges cannot creat any tournaments.
     Second, if n can be expressed as m(m-1)/2, where m is a positive integer and stand for the number of vertices, 
     then at least one tournament can be created. Since the graph is direct, for any vertice pair (u, v), there is exactly one edge from u to v or from v to u.
     Therefore, there are 2 possible choices for the directions of edges, so 2^n different tournaments can be created.
(iii) No. Some of the tournaments do not have cycles, which can be topologically sorted, e.g. 1->2, 1->3, 2->3 can be sorted as 1->2->3.
However, some tournaments do have cycles, which cannot be topologically sorted, e.g. 1->2, 2->3, 3->1 can not be sorted.
